# Session 1: stats                                                         #
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# The basic stats definition of mean, mode, median and standard deviation  #
# are implemented. Also, the mathbot can compute mean, mode, median and    #
# standard deviation for a set of numbers entered by the user.             #

>hello mathbot, I want to ask you something about stats today
Math makes me the sexist chatbot in the world!
>what is mean
The mean/average is obtained by dividing the sum of observed values by the number of observations.
>can you tell me the mean of 1.1 2 3.1 3 4
The mean/average of 1.1 2 3.1 3 4 is: 2.6399999999999997
>what is median
The median is the middle value of a set of data containing an odd number of values, or the average of the two middle values for even numbers of data.
>can you calculate the median of 4 1 2 3
The median of 4 1 2 3 is: 2.5
>what is mode
The mode of a set of data is the value that occurs most frequently.
>can you tell me what is the mode of 1,2,3,1,1,9,9.9,9.9,9.9
The mode of 1,2,3,1,1,9,9.9,9.9,9.9 is: 1
>what is sd
(Looking sad) I want to talk about math...
>what is standard deviation
The standard deviation gives an idea of how close the entire set of data is to the average value.
>what is the sd of 10,20,30,40
The standard deviation (sd) of 10,20,30,40 is: 12.909944487358056
>cool
You've asked more than 10 questions. I'm tired. Our session has ended today.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# If ask more than 3 times on either addition/subtraction alone for length #
# of two input numbers are <=3, then will start the reverse Q/A session.   #
# If answer correctly, the user can continue asking questions.             #

>i want to do some simple math
Please challenge me with any math questions. I'm hungry!
>what is one plus two
The sum of 1 and 2 is: 3.0
>what about 2 + 3
The sum of 2 and 3 is: 5.0
>what is 1000+3   
The sum of 1000 and 3 is: 1003.0
>what is 1 + 2 again?
You have asked me too many simple questions on addition! You should brush up your skills before asking me!
Now, I am going to check if you understand basic addition!
What is  98 plus 67? Answer the question in this format --> q4-sol = your_answer
>q4-sol = 165
Great! Your answer is correct! Let's continue ~
>what's 5-2
The subtraction of 5 from 2 is: 3.0
>what's 4-2
You have been asking questions of Arithmetic type over five times! Can you ask me something else such as: DEFINITION, STATISTICS, EXTRA, INTRO, QNA ???
>quit
Good Bye!

Did you just say Math? It is my favorite subject!
>ok
Please don't count on me answer this kind of question
>what is 2-3
The subtraction of 2 from 3 is: -1.0
>what is 1-2
The subtraction of 1 from 2 is: -1.0
>oh what is 2-3 again?
You have asked me too many simple questions on subtraction! You should brush up your skills before asking me!
Now, I am going to check if you understand basic subtraction!
What is 42 minus 28? Answer the question in this format --> q7-sol = your_answer
>q7-sol=2
Your answer is incorrect. Please do more math before asking me, bye ~
>can you tell me what is 3-2?
Sorry, I can't answer you more questions now.
Practise more math and I hope you do better next time! Good luck!
