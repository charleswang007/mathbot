@Authors: Charles Wang, Alice Man

@Description: Code modified from dog_chat.py (Strout et al), the MathBot is not only trained to answer simple
number problems like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but can solve questions related to
calculus, geometry, linear algebra or statistic.
